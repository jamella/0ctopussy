VmWare Vix Api based fuzzer distribution program

The VIX API allows you to automate virtual machine operations on VMware Workstation, VMware Server, ESX/ESXi hosts, and VMware vSphere.

About the VIX API

The VIX API (or “Vix”) is a library for writing scripts and programs to manipulate virtual machines. It is high-level, easy to use, and practical for both script developers and application programmers. The VIX API is designed for three kinds of users:

Technically Adventurous Users – For example, dedicated IT personnel in an organization building their own in-house tools.
Partners – Software vendors using Vix to integrate VMware products with their own products or to build management products specifically for virtual machines.
VMware Engineering – VMware uses Vix in its own products as a general abstraction layer between core virtual machine processes and associated service processes.
The VIX API runs on Microsoft Windows (Windows95 or later) and Linux platforms (kernel 2.4.x or later recommended). It supports programs written in C, Perl, and COM (Visual Basic, VBscript, C#).

Compatibility

This release of the VIX API is compatible with VMware Workstation, VMware Server, and ESX/ESXi hosts.
